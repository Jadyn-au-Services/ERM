## Activity & Support Expectations

As a member of the team we expect you to maintain a decent activity level. Although there isn’t an enforced quota, that isn’t an excuse for poor activity and lack of contribution. Each member is valued within this team, therefore we expect you to contribute to the community, help users and get involved. Appropriate infractions will apply for lack of activity.

**There is no set infraction system as we do not expect to have to infract any support member. Therefore, if that does apply then infractions are more severe such as termination or suspension.**
<div>*A few basic activity expectations can be found below.*</div>

- **Volunteering in programs:** As a support member usually you are granted access to programs without having to apply or do anything to get inside it. Therefore, get involved, engage and help out in programs.
- **Communicate and engage with the community:** Get to know new people, get involved and communicate with the community.
- **Help users who require support:** This is a fundamental aspect to remaining active. Your purpose is to provide support and to be an ambassador for the community. You are expected to provide educated and accurate support.
- **Chat to fellow support members:** Chat to your fellow support members and get to know them. Your position will feel easier when you know who you are working with.
- **Go above and beyond:** We are always looking for candidates to be promoted to vacant positions and we will only choose those who go above and beyond with helping others.

We recommend you send at least **100** messages per week and handle at least **4** support threads.
