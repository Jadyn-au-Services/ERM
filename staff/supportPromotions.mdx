Promotions are awarded to support members who consistently set a good example, maintain a good activity level and are happy to assist whenever possible. We select individuals who have also shown they can meet the standards we set, on a daily basis. 

**Below is a list on how promotions are obtained and ways promotions cannot be obtained.**

- <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> Going above and beyond and volunteering to help within programs and other community projects.
- <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> Going above and beyond by actively helping users within support threads, guiding users to the correct place and overall being a good ambassador towards the community.
- <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" /> Showing you can be trusted within the position you are currently at - this means minimal disciplinary actions.

- <Icon icon="x" iconType="solid" /> Asking, begging or hinting for a promotion because you haven’t had one in a long time.
- <Icon icon="x" iconType="solid" /> Complaining you haven’t been promoted but someone else has - this just shows you are only here to obtain power.
- <Icon icon="x" iconType="solid" /> Only being active when promotions are hinted - this shows that you are only contributing when something beneficial to you is announced which shows immaturity.

Support members will only be moved onto Senior Support when they have met the above criteria and have been within their current position for a suitable amount of time. Senior Support members have a big responsibility to ensure the support team understands all the guidelines and more. They are also responsible for helping trial support by conducting simulations and other training stages to ensure they fully understand the ropes of working with us.
