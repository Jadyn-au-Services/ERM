## Community Engagement

As a support member we expect you to engage with the community. It’s a good way to represent the team well and get to know who you might be helping out in the future. You are the ambassadors of the community so ensure you are greeting new people and generally being a good and respectful person.

## Community Programs & Volunteering

We provide numerous projects for guilds and users to get involved. We may sometimes rely on the help of the support team to assist the programs and ensure they are actively serving their purpose.
<div>**We offer the following programs for you to help out within:**</div>

- **Quality Assurance Program.** Despite this program being removed to those who applied, we still have it open to support members. We require you to test updates, provide feedback and share your thoughts with us.
- **Affiliate Program.** Despite this being locked to verified affiliates, support members are given access to the Development Server in which we also expect you to engage within and provide feedback where necessary.
- **Bug Hunter Program.** This program is being revamped however when it is released around December 2023 we’re looking to provide USD rewards for those who successfully find major bugs that could affect performance.
