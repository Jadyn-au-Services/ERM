The support guidelines below are to be abided by at all times. Individuals who are caught breaking the guidelines below will be subject to appropriate infractions depending on the severity of the situation. Upon joining our team you agree you are subject to infraction for any misrepresentation or irresponsibility within the team.

1. **Treat each individual with respect.**
> Users deserve to be spoken to in a respectful and inclusive tone. No matter the scenario, you must act mature and responsible to ensure you are the bigger person. There are ways to deal with noncompliant users by simply utilising the moderation commands specifically assigned to each support member. This guideline also applies to treating your colleagues with respect.

2. **Working within a competitor's support team.**
> We prohibit support members within our team working alongside bots that are competitors to us. This includes Trident & Melonly. This also applies to Quality Assurance as there is a risk you may share disclosed information towards competitors.

3. **Have an appropriate profile.**
> As a support team member, your role is hoisted. This means the community can see your profile without scrolling down meaning it is more appealing. Your profile must be kept appropriate. This means no harmful or discriminatory content situated within it.

4. **Let us know if you are going inactive.**
> Prior to going inactive, let us know. Submit a Leave of Absence via the ⁠loa-request and we'll approve it accordingly. You have lives and other activities and we completely respect and personally understand ourselves. There's no 'limit' on how many you submit but you may be asked to resign if you are continuously submitting them.

5. **Handling support threads.**
> Each support thread should be limited to 1 support member. Multiple support members handling one ticket makes it very uncoordinated and difficult for the user to understand. This rule has been broken numerous times and you'll be removed for repeat offences. You are only allowed to intervene when the original ticket handler has permitted you to enter. You should only be handling a support thread if you fully understand what the user is asking about, otherwise do not handle it.

6. **Do not abuse your position or title.**
> Using your position to get out of moderations or simply as an advantage within other communities is strictly prohibited. You'll be removed for misrepresentation if this occurs.

7. **Use your common sense.**
> Be logical and use your common sense. If you think something will get you in trouble, think twice and think is it worth saying it or doing it. You can still be infracted for other reasons that are not explicitly stated within the support guidelines.

8. **Maintain a welcoming tone & attitude.**
> Be positive, inclusive and welcoming towards others. Welcome new members to the community, guide users to the appropriate areas within the server and just help those who require assistance. As a community we are dedicated to ensure users receive accurate and educated support, help us maintain this by helping others.

9. **Support promotions.**
> We cannot stress this enough; you will not be promoted because you've asked or hinted for a promotion. We nominate individuals for a promotion if we deem them fit enough for the above position. Promotions aren't held frequently therefore asking for a promotion will 100% not get you one.

10. **Do not close inactive tickets.**
> Whenever a ticket goes inactive, you may do a /closerequest with a delay of 24 or 48 (hours). Before doing this, make sure you properly answered all of the user's questions.
If the user requires developer assistance, you may NOT close the ticket until a dev fixes the bug that's being reported.
The /closerequest reasons should either be ''Resolved, thank you for choosing ERM'' or ''Inactive ticket, reply or this is getting closed''.

11. **Weekly quota**
> You must meet the weekly quota of 4 ticket(s)/week. Failure to do so may result in removal from the support team.
